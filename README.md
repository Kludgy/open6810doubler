Open 6810 Doubler for the Atari 1050 Disk Drive
===============================================

This repository holds KiCad files for a PCB that, when used in conjunction with a custom Atari 1050 ROM, increases the available SRAM in a stock Atari 1050 Disk Drive from 128 bytes to 256 bytes. The 256 bytes of RAM is presumably enough to fit an entire sector's worth of data. Far more information can be found here: http://blog.3b2.sk/igi/post/Atari-1050-ICD-US-doubler.aspx

BOM: 
* 2x MCM6810.
* 2x Pin Header Strips to socket the PCB into the original 6810 location on the mainboard.
* 1x 24-pin socket on the mainboard as you wish.

Be advised the PCB will need to be socketed high enough to clear other components on the board.
